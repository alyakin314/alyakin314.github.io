I am an Assistant Research Engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Department
of Applied Mathematics & Statistics.
I primarily work with Professor [Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/)
on problems in classical statistics and modern data science, such as
multivariate analysis, robust hypothesis testing, curved mixture estimates, and
statistical inference on graphs.

I graduated from the Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelor of Science degree
in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics in May 2019, and a
Master of Science in Engineering degree in Applied Mathematics & Statistics in
December 2019.
During my time as a student I was fortunate to be advised by [Suchi
Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) and
[Avanti Athreya](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/faculty/avanti-athreya/).

I am currently applying to Ph.D. & M.D.-Ph.D programs, as my primary research
interests are the development of diagnostic clinical decision support tools and
other intersections of machine learning and medicine.

I consider myself a frequentist in philosophy, but a Bayesian in practice.
