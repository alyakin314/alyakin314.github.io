### Status Quo

I am a medical student at Washington University in Saint Louis School of 
Medicine. I am currently applying for the 2026 Neurological Surgery Match.
My research is in applying statistical and computational approachces to 
neuroscience, neurosurgery, and medicine at large.

### Road So Far

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a [BS in Computer Science](https://alyakin314.github.io/assets/papers/Alyakin_Motif_Discovery_in_the_Irregulary_Sampled_Time_Series_Data.pdf)
in May 2019 and an [MSE in Applied Mathematics & Statistics](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/f33e2b8e-d18d-4a03-b14c-bede28b441ec/content)
in December 2019.
While a student there I was fortunate to be advised by
[Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) and
[Avanti Athreya](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/faculty/avanti-athreya/).
During my gap year I worked as an Assistant Research Engineer at my alma mater's
Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics. I was a part of the
[NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/) lab and primarily worked with
[Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/) on various problems in
statistical graph inference and with [Joshua Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/) on
causal inference from observational health data.

I started medical school at WashU in 2021.
In 2024, I took a research gap year during which I was a CNS AI fellow at NYU
[OLAB](https://www.nyuolab.org/) under the supervision of
[Dr. Eric Oermann](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1235498403/eric-k-oermann).
I was co-advised by
[Dr. Eric Leuthardt](https://neurosurgery.wustl.edu/people/eric-c-leuthardt-md/)
at my home institution. During that time I worked on intersections of 
vision-language models with neurosurgery.

### Research Interests

I have worked on various topics spanning connectome statistics, causal decision
support, clinical artificial intelligence, and computational safety. Some
notable papers are listed below.

#### Connectome and Graph-based Statistics

- [Valid Two-Sample Graph Testing via Optimal Transport Procrustes and Multiscale Graph Correlation with Applications in Connectomics](https://doi.org/10.1002/sta4.429) (*Stat*, 2021)
- [An Analysis of Euclidean vs. Graph-Based Framing for Bilingual Lexicon Induction from Word Embedding Spaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12640) (*Findings of the ACL: EMNLP 2021)
- [Correcting a Nonparametric Two-sample Graph Hypothesis Test for Graphs with Different Numbers of Vertices with Applications to Connectomics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-023-00607-x) (*Applied Network Science*, 2024)

#### Causal Decision Support

- [Using Machine Learning for Early Prediction of Cardiogenic Shock in Patients with Acute Heart Failure](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jscai.2022.100308) (*Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions*, 2022)
- [Exploration of Residual Confounding in Analyses of Associations of Metformin Use and Outcomes in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.41505) (*JAMA Network Open*, 2022)
- [Clinical Prediction for Surgical versus Nonsurgical Interventions in Patients with Vertebral Osteomyelitis and Discitis](https://doi.org/10.21037/jss-23-111) (*Journal of Spine Surgery*, 2024)

#### Clinical Artificial Intelligence

- [CNS-CLIP: Transforming a Neurosurgical Journal into a Multimodal Medical Model](https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000003297) (*Neurosurgery*, 2025)
- [CNS-Obsidian: A Neurosurgical Vision-Language Model Built From Scientific Publications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19546) (preprint, 2025)
- [MedMobile: A mobile-sized language model with clinical capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09019) (*BMJ Digital Health and AI*, 2025)

#### Computational Safety

- [Medical Large Language Models are Vulnerable to Data-poisoning Attacks](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03445-1) (*Nature Medicine*, 2025)
- [Pitfalls of Multiple-Choice Questions in Generative AI and Medical Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13508) (*Scientific Reports*, 2025)
- [Medical Large Language Models are Easily Distracted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01201) (preprint, 2025)
