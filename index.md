I am a Masters student at Johns Hopkins University in Applied Mathematics and
Statistics.
I am advised by Professor Avanti Atheya. I also do research with  Professor 
[Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/).
My research interests primarily lie in the domains of Statistical Learning and
its applications to biomedical problems.
# You can read about some of my research [here](/pages/research.html).

I graduated from the Johns Hopkins University in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science
in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics.
During my undergraduate I was fortunate to be advised by
[Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/).

I consider myself a frequentist in philosophy, but a Bayesian in practice.
