## Status Quo

I am a medical student at Washington University in Saint Louis School of 
Medicine. I am currently applying for the 2026 Neurological Surgery Match.


**Road So Far**

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a [BS in Computer Science](https://alyakin314.github.io/assets/papers/Alyakin_Motif_Discovery_in_the_Irregulary_Sampled_Time_Series_Data.pdf)
in May 2019 and an [MSE in Applied Mathematics & Statistics](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/f33e2b8e-d18d-4a03-b14c-bede28b441ec/content)
in December 2019.
While a student there I was fortunate to be advised by
[Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) and
[Avanti Athreya](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/faculty/avanti-athreya/).
During my gap year I worked as an Assistant Research Engineer at my alma mater's
Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics. I was a part of the
[NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/) lab and primarily worked with
[Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/) on various problems in
statistical graph inference and with [Joshua Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/) on
causal inference from observational health data.
In 2024, I took a research gap year during which I was a CNS AI fellow at NYU
[OLAB](https://www.nyuolab.org/) under the supervision of
[Dr. Eric Oermann](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1235498403/eric-k-oermann).
I was co-advised by
[Dr. Eric Leuthardt](https://neurosurgery.wustl.edu/people/eric-c-leuthardt-md/)
at my home institution. During that time I worked on intersections of 
vision-language models with neurosurgery.

## **Research Interests**

I have worked on various topics spanning connectome statistics, clinical 
artificial intelligence, and computational safety.

**Connectome Statistics**

**Key Papers:**
- [Correcting a Nonparametric Two-sample Graph Hypothesis Test for Graphs with Different Numbers of Vertices with Applications to Connectomics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-024-00629-0) (*Applied Network Science*, 2024) 
- [Valid Two-Sample Graph Testing via Optimal Transport Procrustes and Multiscale Graph Correlation with Applications in Connectomics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sta4.411) (*Stat*, 2021) 

** Clinical Artificial Intelligence **

- [CNS-CLIP: Transforming a Neurosurgical Journal into a Multimodal Medical Model](https://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/) (*Neurosurgery*, 2025)
- [MedMobile: A mobile-sized language model with clinical capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10991) (*BMJ Digital Health and AI*, to appear 2025)
- [Repurposing the Scientific Literature with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01388) (preprint, 2025)

** Computational Safety **

- [Medical Large Language Models are Vulnerable to Data-poisoning Attacks](https://www.nature.com/nm/) (*Nature Medicine*, 2025)
- [Medical Large Language Models are Easily Distracted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12049) (preprint, 2025)
- [It is Too Many Options: Pitfalls of Multiple-Choice Questions in Generative AI and Medical Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01094) (preprint, 2025)
