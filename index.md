**Status Quo**

Since March 2025 I am, again, a full-time medical student at Washington
University of Saint Louis School of Medicine. I aim to apply to the 2026 
Neurological Surgery Match. Very rarely but I do get time to do AI research.
<!--
At this stage of my soul-searching I am most likely to pursue
a career in ~~emergency medicine~~ ~~critical care~~ ~~anesthesiology~~
~~neurosurgery~~ ~~cardiac surgery~~ neurosurgery.
-->

**Road So Far**

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a [BS in Computer Science](https://alyakin314.github.io/assets/papers/Alyakin_Motif_Discovery_in_the_Irregulary_Sampled_Time_Series_Data.pdf)
in May 2019 and an [MSE in Applied Mathematics & Statistics](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/f33e2b8e-d18d-4a03-b14c-bede28b441ec/content)
in December 2019.
While a student there I was fortunate to be advised by
[Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) and
[Avanti Athreya](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/faculty/avanti-athreya/).
During ~~COVID~~ my gap year I worked as an Assistant Research Engineer at my
alma mater's Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics. I was a part of the
[NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/) lab and primarily worked with
[Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/) on various problems in
statistical graph inference and with [Joshua Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/) on
causal inference from observational health data. I started an MD-PhD program at
Washington University School of Medicine in 2021, but later decided to only
pursue the first two letters out of five. In 2024, I took a research gap year
during which I was a CNS AI fellow at NYU
[OLAB](https://www.nyuolab.org/) under the supervision of Dr.
[Eric Oermann](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1235498403/eric-k-oermann).
I was co-advised by Dr.
[Eric Leuthardt](https://neurosurgery.wustl.edu/people/eric-c-leuthardt-md/)
at my home institution. During that time I work on intersections of 
vision-language models with the field of Neurosurgery.

**Research Interests**

Research-wise, I am curious about
1. artificial intelligence, and why might neural networks have some already,
2. human intelligence, and why I might not have any still.

Most of my recent work has been on Large Language Models (LLMs) and 
Vision-Language Models, after they became cool. My research interests outside
of LLMs&Neurosurgery include statistical inference on connectome networks,
diagnostic and prognostic clinical decision support tools, among other
intersections of statistics and medicine. I also broadly care about causality
and consciousness.

**P.S.**

Every math answer I give you is always up to a
sign/inverse/reciprocal/transpose/etc. Constants are overrated.

I consider myself a frequentist in philosophy, but a Bayesian in practice.

I probably don't understand determinism...
