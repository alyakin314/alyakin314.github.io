I am an Assistant Research Engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Department
of Applied Mathematics & Statistics.
I primarily work with Professor [Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/)
on problems in classical statistics and modern data science, such as
multivariate analysis, robust hypothesis testing, curved mixture estimates, and
statistical inference on graphs.

I graduated from the Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelor of Science degree
in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics in May 2019, and a
Master of Science in Engineering degree in Applied Mathematics & Statistics in
December 2019.
During my time as a student I was fortunate to be advised by [Suchi
Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) and
[Avanti Athreya](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/faculty/avanti-athreya/).

I am currently applying to M.D.-Ph.D programs, as my primary research interests
are the development of diagnostic clinical decision support tools and other
intersections of machine learning and medicine.

I consider myself a frequentist in philosophy, but a Bayesian in practice.



[//]: # **Frequently Asked Question[s]**
[//]: # 
[//]: # *Do you own multiple of these tracksuits?*
[//]: # 
[//]: # Yes, I have 5 identical tracksuits and 12 identical T-shirts.
[//]: # I wear them every day unless forced to do otherwise by some obstacles (e.g. an
[//]: # interview).
[//]: # The primary reason why I started doing this is because I wanted to routinize
[//]: # this aspect of my life and spend mental energy thinking about things that are
[//]: # interesting to me rather than \"what do I wear today\"\"does this match\"\"can I
[//]: # wash these together\".
[//]: # I am also a proponent of function over form in most circumstances and I simply
[//]: # do not feel comfortable wearing other things.
[//]: # I got the inspiration to do this from Prof. Avanti Athreya (but she is not aware
[//]: # of this :) ).
