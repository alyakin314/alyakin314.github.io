I am a Masters student at Johns Hopkins University pursuing a degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics.
I am advised by Professor Avanti Atheya. I also work with  Professor 
[Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/).
My current work is primarily in computational statistics, mixture estimates, and statistical inference for high-dimensional and graph data.

I graduated from the Johns Hopkins University in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science
in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics.
During my undergraduate I was fortunate to be advised by
[Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/).
My Senior Honors Thesis was on the _Motif Discovery in the Irregularly Sampled Time Series Data_.

My goal is to pursue a joint M.D.-Ph.D. degree and work as a physician scientist, tackling the problems related to medical diagnosis using machine learning approaches.

I consider myself a frequentist in philosophy, but a Bayesian in practice.



**Frequently Asked Question[s]**

*Do you own multiple of these tracksuits?*

I get this question A LOT.
Yes, I have 5 identical tracksuits and 12 identical T-shirts.
I wear them every day unless forced to do otherwise by some obstacles (e.g. an
interview).
The primary reason why I started doing this is because I wanted to routinize
this aspect of my life and spend mental energy thinking about things that are
interesting to me rather than "what do I wear today"/"does this match"/"can I
wash these together".
I am also a proponent of function other form in most circumstances and I simply
do not feel comfortable wearing over things.
I got the inspiration to do this from Prof. Avanti Athreya (but she is not aware
of this :) ).
