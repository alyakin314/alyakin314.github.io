I am an incoming MD-PhD student at the Washington University School of Medicine
in St. Louis. My primary research interests are development of diagnostic
clinical decision support tools and other intersections of machine learning and
medicine.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a BS in Computer Science in
May 2019 and an MSE in Applied Mathematics & Statistics in December 2019. 
While a student there I was fortunate to be advised by
[Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) and
[Avanti Athreya](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/faculty/avanti-athreya/).

During ~~COVID~~ my gap year I worked as an Assistant Research Engineer at my
alma mater's Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics. I was a part of the
[NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/) lab and primarily worked with
[Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/) on various problems in
statistical graph inference and with [Joshua Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/) on
causal inference from observational health data.

I consider myself a frequentist in philosophy, but a Bayesian in practice.

Every math answer I give you is always up to a
sign/inverse/reciprocal/transpose/etc. Constants are overrated.

<!--
I probably don't understand determinism...
