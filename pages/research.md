### Ongoing Projects
- Corrupted Adjacency Spectral Embedding and Valid Latent Distribution Permutation Test for Random Graphs

### Software
1. [lqrt](https://github.com/alyakin314/lqrt)
  - lqrt implements the the Robust Hypothesis Testing of Location Parameters
    using Lq-Likelihood-Ratio-Type Test in Python. I am the sole author and the
    maintainer.
2. [graph primitives of the D3M Program](https://github.com/neurodata/primitives-interfaces)
  - The Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program aims to develop automated
    model discovery systems that enable users with subject matter expertise but
    no data science background to create empirical models of real, complex
    processes.
    I am one of the primary mainterners of the primitives that are JHU's
    contribution to the D3M's library of selectable primitives that are used as
    basic building blocks in the automated model discovery process.
    Our primitives are aimed at tackling machine learning problems with graph
    (aks network) inputs, such as Vertex Classification, Community Detection,
    Link Prediction and Seeded Graph Matching.
