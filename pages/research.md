### Software
1. [lqrt](https://github.com/alyakin314/lqrt)
  - I am the author and the maintainer of the lqrt, a package implements the
    the Robust Hypothesis Testing of Location Parameters using
    Lq-Likelihood-Ratio-Type Test in Python.
2. [Graph Primitives of the Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) Program](https://github.com/neurodata/primitives-interfaces)
  - I am one of the primary mainterners of the repository that is JHU's
    contribution to the D3M's library of selectable primitives that are used as
    basic building blocks in the automated model discovery process.
    Our primitives are aimed at tackling machine learning problems with graph,
    or netowrk, inputs, such as Vertex Classification, Community Detection,
    Link Prediction and Seeded Graph Matching.
3. [graspy](https://github.com/neurodata/graspy)
  - I contribute to graspy, an open-souce Python package for doing statistical
    analyses on network-valued data.

### Ongoing Projects
- **A. Alyakin**, H. Helm, and  C. E. Priebe, Two-sample Permutation Testing for Random Dot Product Graphs of Varying Size, In Progress.
