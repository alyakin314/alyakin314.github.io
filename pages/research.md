### Software
1. [lqrt](https://github.com/alyakin314/lqrt)
  - I am the author and maintainer of the lqrt, a package implements the
    Robust Hypothesis Testing of Location Parameters using
    Lq-Likelihood-Ratio-Type Test in Python.
2. [graspy](https://github.com/neurodata/graspy)
  - I regulary contribute to graspy, an open-souce Python package for doing
    statistical analyses on network-valued data. In particular, my contributions
    include modifications to LatentDistributionTest and LatentPositionTest.
3. [Graph Primitives of the Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M)
   Program](https://github.com/neurodata/primitives-interfaces)
  - I am one of the primary mainterners of the repository that is JHU's
    contribution to the D3M's library of selectable primitives that are used as
    basic building blocks in the automated model discovery process.
    Our primitives are aimed at tackling machine learning problems with graph,
    or netowrk, inputs, such as Vertex Classification, Community Detection,
    Link Prediction and Seeded Graph Matching.

### Ongoing Projects
- **A. Alyakin**, J. Agterberg, H. Helm, and  C. E. Priebe, Correcting a
  Nonparametric Two-sample Graph Hypothesis Test for Graphs with Different
  Numbers of Vertices, In Progress.
